//How to do Nim - (This is just one way to do it)
	// Assign Variables
		// integer for pile 1, pile 2, and pile 3 thats stores how many stones (lets use p1, p2, p3)
		
	// while loop that runs as long as all of the piles are not 0
		// print the (pile #: the variables we made in line 3)
		
		//print (from which pile?)
			//get input from user using scanner (make sure to make a scanner before) - assign it to a new var (lets use pile)
		//print (how many?)
			//get input from user using scanner - assign it to a new var (we're gonna use variable name num_take)
		
		//if loop:
			//if the pile is 1,
				//take num_take from p1 (using subtraction)
			//else if pile is 2,
				//take num_take from p2 (using subtraction)
			//else if pile is 1,
				//take num_take from p3 (using subtraction)
		
		//print (taking num_take from pile)
		
		//if loop: if p1 is 0 and p2 is 0 and p3 is 0
			//print (you lose...hahahaha .... you lose :P)
